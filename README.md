#### Burn down chart
A burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The outstanding work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. Burn down charts are a run chart of outstanding work. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed.

sum of task estimates(days) vs iteration timeline(days)


#### if task not completed in sprint 
"All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.

#### product backlog 
The product backlog is a priority list of user requirements, use cases to be done in order to create, maintain and sustain a product. Product Owner owns the product backlog,(s)he is the one who prioritize it based on the customers feedback or business value.
