# Agile

#### what is scrum?
Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
Scrum itself is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products. 

#### what is velocity ?

In agile velocity is the amount of work done during a sprint

sprint 1 -10 story points completed
sprit 2- 20 story points completed
velocity - 15 

#### Burn down chart
A burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The outstanding work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. Burn down charts are a run chart of outstanding work. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed.

sum of task estimates(days) vs iteration timeline(days)


#### if task not completed in sprint 
"All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.

#### product backlog 
The product backlog is a priority list of user requirements, use cases to be done in order to create, maintain and sustain a product. Product Owner owns the product backlog,(s)he is the one who prioritize it based on the customers feedback or business value. 
#### Sprint backlog 
Sprint backlog is the subset of the product backlog. Each sprint, scrum team picks the user stories from product backlog on top of its stack, the number of user story picked by scrum team for a time box sprint is based on the average velocity of a scrum team.

####  Here is a list of potential issues that a QA (Quality Assurance) Manager might face:

##### Lack of clear quality standards: 
If there are no well-defined quality standards and expectations, the QA Manager may struggle to ensure that the team is delivering high-quality products.

##### Inadequate resources: 
Insufficient resources, such as budget, staff, or testing tools, can hinder the effectiveness of the QA Manager and the quality of the testing process.

##### Poor communication and collaboration: 
If there is a lack of effective communication and collaboration between the QA Manager, development teams, and other stakeholders, it can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and lower-quality products.

##### Unrealistic timeframes: 
When development schedules are too tight or unrealistic, the QA Manager may not have sufficient time for thorough testing and quality assurance, compromising the overall quality of the product.

##### Resistance to change: 
If the organization or development teams are resistant to adopting new testing methodologies, technologies, or process improvements, it can hinder the QA Manager's efforts to implement best practices and drive quality improvements.

##### Insufficient testing coverage: 
If the testing efforts are not comprehensive enough, critical defects may go undetected, leading to lower product quality and customer dissatisfaction.

#####  Ineffective defect management: 
If there is poor tracking and management of defects, it can result in delays in resolving issues, inefficient workflows, and increased rework, impacting the overall product quality.

##### Lack of training and professional development opportunities: 
If the QA Manager and the testing team do not have access to training and professional development resources, their skills may become outdated, and they may struggle to keep up with evolving industry practices and technologies.

##### Inadequate documentation:
Insufficient documentation of test plans, test cases, and test results can lead to confusion, difficulties in reproducing issues, and challenges in maintaining consistent quality across releases.

##### Lack of recognition and support: 
If the contributions and value of the QA Manager and the testing team are not acknowledged and supported by the organization, it can demotivate them and hinder their ability to drive quality improvements effectively.

## As a QA (Quality Assurance) professional, conflicts with teammates can arise in various situations. Here is a list of potential conflicts and some suggestions on how to handle them:

##### Disagreements on quality standards: 
If there are disagreements about the definition of quality or the appropriate level of testing, it is important to have open and respectful discussions. Seek to understand different perspectives and find common ground. Communicate the importance of adhering to established quality standards and collaborate with teammates to reach a consensus.

##### Lack of cooperation from developers: 
In some cases, developers may be resistant to fixing reported defects or implementing suggested improvements. To address this, establish effective communication channels with the development team. Clearly explain the impact of unresolved issues on product quality and customer satisfaction. Provide concrete evidence, such as detailed bug reports or test results, to support your points. Work together to find mutually beneficial solutions and prioritize critical issues.

##### Communication breakdowns: 
Poor communication between team members can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and conflicts. Foster open and transparent communication within the team. Encourage regular meetings, stand-ups, and status updates to ensure everyone is informed. Actively listen to your teammates, clarify expectations, and address any miscommunications promptly. Use collaborative tools, such as project management software or communication platforms, to enhance communication efficiency.

##### Resource conflicts: 
Limited availability of resources, such as testing environments or tools, can create tensions between team members. Collaborate with stakeholders to identify and prioritize resource needs. Clearly communicate the resource limitations to the team and involve them in finding alternative solutions. Advocate for necessary resources and work towards optimizing resource allocation to support efficient testing.

##### Role overlaps and boundaries: 
When responsibilities overlap or boundaries are unclear, conflicts can arise. Establish clear roles and responsibilities for each team member. If there are overlaps, discuss and align on the division of tasks. Encourage collaboration and mutual support while respecting individual expertise. Maintain open channels for feedback and address any concerns promptly.

##### Personal conflicts or differences: 
Occasionally, conflicts can arise due to personal differences or clashes of personalities. It is important to maintain a professional attitude and focus on the work at hand. Foster a positive team environment and encourage respect and empathy among team members. If conflicts persist, involve a neutral third party, such as a project manager or team lead, to help mediate the situation.

##### Resistance to QA processes: 
Team members may resist following established QA processes or participating in testing activities. Clearly communicate the benefits of QA processes and involve the team in defining and improving those processes. Educate teammates on the value of testing and quality assurance in delivering high-quality products. Provide training and support to help team members understand and contribute effectively to the QA efforts.
